        <h2>A Brief History of Events</h2>
        <p>The National Indian Gaming Commission was created in 1988. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act created it as a way for the government to regulate tribal <span id=gaming-tooltip>gaming.<br><span id=gaming-tooltip-body> (Gaming in this context means gambling, not playing video games) </span></span></p>

        <p>Some tribal goverments had made the argument that state gambling laws did not apply in their reservations and that they had the right to offer gambling facilities within their reservations. Lawsuits followed, and eventually, a doctrine was established.</p>
        <p>In states where gambling is a criminal activity, it was decided that it would not be allowed on reservations. However, if a state was <i>regulating</i> gambling, and it wasn't actually prohibited, it would be up to the tribal government to regulate it however they wished. The distinction between regulating how gambling is done and prohibiting it gave tribal governments in some states the legal power to set up casinos.</p>

        <p>In 1987, the case <i>California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians</i> reached the Supreme Court. The Cabazon Band had set up gambling facilities, and the state was trying to shut it down. The court ruled that this violated their sovereignty and that tribal governments had the right to regulate gambling on their own land.</p>

        <p>Soon after, Congress decided to pass the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which would make it clear what rights tribes had when gaming. It divided Indian gaming into three categories:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Class I gaming is traditional chance games played by tribes, which are not regulated at all by the government.</li>
            <li>Class II gaming is games like bingo and poker, which are jointly regulated by the tribal government and the National Indian Gaming Commission.</li>
            <li>Class III gaming is games like blackjack and slot machines. These need to be cleared with the commission and are usually limited in scope by the government.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Today, many tribes have set up Class II and III gaming facilities and brought in lots of revenue, which goes to support their tribes.</p>
