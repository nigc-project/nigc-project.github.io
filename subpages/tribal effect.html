        <h2>Effect on Tribes</h2>
        <p>When asked for comment on the effects gaming has had on tribes, the National Indian Gaming Commission replied:</p>
        <blockquote>
            Revenue generated from Tribal gaming operations has helped to fund Tribal health and community service programs, law enforcement and education services. We have seen repeated instances where Tribes who have successfully operated gaming establishments have expanded over the years from a single facility to multiple operations across their lands.

        <p>The funds from gaming operations go directly to tribes. As described in the quote above, the revenue can be used to help strengthen tribal communities. Some of these tribes are isolated and therefore cannot easily engage with the economy, or have reservations on infertile land that can't be used to sell materials. Gaming offers a way for these communities to fund themselves and grow their economies, giving them access to better opportunities.</p>
        <p>The total revenue brought in by Indian gaming nationwide in 2023 was $41.9 billion. This money goes straight toward the betterment of the tribes running the operations and creates a meaningful difference in quality of life.</p>
        <br>
        <p>An excellent example of this occuring is the case of the Seminole Nation. The Seminole Nation was one of the first to embrace gaming as a form of revenue, and, while their operations predated the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act and therefore encountered legal difficulties, it ended up being massively successful. The tribe wrote to a government official who had been attempting to shut down their bingo operations:</p>
        <blockquote>
            Between 1945 and 1977 an average of 4.3 tribal members per
year graduated from high school. From 1978 to 1986, there were an
average of thirteen high school graduates per year. From 1945 to 1977
nine tribal members received college or junior college degrees. From
1978 to 1986 twenty-eight members graduated from college or junior
college, including one person who received a master's degree, and
another who received a law degree. The Tribe now provides
scholarships for worthy students, and of the twenty-seven identifiable
special education programs available to tribal members, twenty are
either wholly or partially funded by the Tribe.<br><br>
Since 1982, the Tribe has funded a Seminole Cultural
Education program which operates on all the residential reservations.
The program, which utilizes bilingual University of Miami specialists
and other experts, seeks to retain the cultural values, knowledge, and
language of the Seminoles and heighten the awareness of the Seminole
children to the uniqueness of their heritage.<br><br>
A tribal newspaper, the Seminole Tribune, began publication in
1983 and is distributed to all tribal members as well as government
offices, other Tribes, and various others interested in news of the
Seminoles.<br><br>
Finally, in 1981, the Seminole Police Department was created
with law enforcement jurisdiction over the separate reservation areas.
In the 1985-86 fiscal year, the Department employed 26 full time
personnel, with the Tribe bearing approximately 85 percent of the total
cost of the Department’s budget... the Department has been successful in
apprehending non-Indian narcotics violators and, in the past two
years, has confiscated two planes and several vehicles engaged in
narcotics violations in Indian country.<br><br>
Bingo revenues have been an important part of the Seminole
Tribe’s ability to enhance and protect the lives of its members.
        </blockquote>
        <p>The tribe's ability to enhance and protect the lives of its members, in the end, is the reason why Indian gaming matters.</p>
