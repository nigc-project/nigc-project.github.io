        <h2>Is This Agency Really Necessary?</h2>
        <p><span class=highlight>Yes</span>. The National Indian Gaming Commission provides tribes with guidance and regulation on how to operate gaming. Their oversight allows Native American nations to set up gaming facilities, bringing in revenue that is used to further the welfare of the nation.</p>

        <p>In 2023, the total revenue brought in by Indian gaming was $41.9 billion, an increase of 2.4%. The total number of gaming operations was in excess of five hundred. Without the oversight of the National Indian Gaming Commission, it would have been impossible for these nations to operate gaming at this scale; without regulation, bad actors likely would have abused the system and stolen the profit from them.</p>
        <p>The regulations enforced by the commission ensure that "any indications of corrupting
influences that may jeopardize the integrity of tribal gaming" are removed, allowing the money earned from gaming operations to go straight toward helping tribal communities.</p>

        <p>The National Indian Gaming Commission's work allows tribes to bring in money, allowing them to fund their community work and their public services. The introduction of an unambiguously legal way of setting up gaming operations has reinforced tribal sovereignty by giving tribes a way to fund themselves. The commission costs a low amount to run, but it clears out red tape and makes legal difficulties fade away. Its impact is <span class=highlight>massive</span>.</p>
