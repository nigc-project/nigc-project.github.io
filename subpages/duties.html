        <p>Out of these, their main job is "approving or disapproving gaming ordinances". Their main job is to watch over tribes developing gaming facilities and ensuring that they comply with the regulations set by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, and they do this through the system of submitting ordinances.</p>

        <p>If a tribe wants to set up a gaming operation, they must first submit an ordinance to the National Indian Gaming Commission. This declares how the gaming operation will be planned and operated, and it creates a plan for auditing to ensure that the funds from the operation are not being mismanaged. From there, the chairman of the commission has up to ninety days to deliberate and then either approve or disapprove the ordinance. As long as all of the requirements set by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act are met, the ordinance will be approved.</p>
        <p>The act's requirements essentially place down checks and balances to ensure that there is no fraud being committed and that the money from the tribe's gaming operations actually go to tribes. For example, one of them is that "appropriate tribal officials... have a right to verify the daily gross revenues and income made from any such tribal gaming activity."</p>

        <p>Once a ordinance has been approved, the tribe can begin setting up their gaming operation. Tribes can have multiple facilties running at once, and many of the larger ones do.</p>
